# time-recording-button

i wanted to track how much time i spent on a project, without having to have access to a distraction rectangle. 

i have a button wired up to a raspberry pi. when i press the button, the light comes on, and the start time is recorded in a text file. when i press it again, the light turns off, and the stop time is recorded.
